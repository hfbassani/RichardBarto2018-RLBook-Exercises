### *Exercise 8.1:*

**The non-planning method looks particularly poor in Figure 8.3 because it is a one-step method; a method using multi-step bootstrapping would do better. Do you think one of the multi-step bootstrapping methods from Chapter 7 could do as well as the Dyna method? Explain why or why not.**
